                <h2>Visitor Analysis</h2>

                <p>This website did a great job at aiming their mobile website at users seeking simple and strait foreward information. It us easy to navigate with the fingers on a mobile screen. Their target demographic seems to be a general 20 year old to 50 year old area of people, and the white color to thew page all throughout makes it so there isnt necessarily a gender refrence. The site met the needs of the visitor by making easy to push buttons that give limited information that is still esy to understand where it will take you and what its for. The site was organized well to facilitate it being found because it was the forst one that came up and it has easy links to find.To make its use enjoyable the site gave several simple options to listen to podcasts, radio, or just read information and i apreciated this. The site really fasilitated people on a mobile environment because it made everything clear and uniform and it followed the PARC-T rules very well.</p>

                <h2>Persona</h2>

                <p>The persona I chose was a 30 year old college graduate who was newly hired as a doctors assistant with a small time medical practice that goes to east Africa each year to help with humanitarian aid and medical services. This man uses NPR to stay with modern news and likes to use it because he feels that it has less of a lean towards one way or another and just reports on the facts. He also likes it because it has a better focus on world news, instead of just American news.<br> Quote - "I went to npr to get some more information on what people feel of current events in Sudan right now and see if im missing any news there." </p>
                <h2>Contrast</h2>www.scripture4all.org<br><br>This mobile website does not use the PARC-T principles very well. This is a website  that delvs into the hebrew behind old text and the bible. This site does a bad job because its top of the page has very little help in using the site, I couldnt find a search bar, the allignment masnt uniform, the contrast was ok, but lacked interest, and the typgraphy was the same all throughout, which actually made it hard to tell what was important, or not. </p>

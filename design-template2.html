            <!-- ***********************************************
Each design principle needs four items:
1- The principle's name and the team member responsible for it.
2- An image (screenshot) of the mobile browser screen showing the design principle in use.
3- The site name used in the picture
4- A discussion of how the design principle is exemplified in the picture. Be detailed!

            <h2>Proximity &mdash; Austin Smith </h2>
            <img src="../Eleets.github.io/images/bbc.jpg" alt="Screen shot illustrating alignment in use">
            <p>
                BBC.com
            </p>
            <p>
                BBC has great proximity because it has multiple boxes, they are all next to each other in an organized clean matter, and they accentuate the other boxes. It also has open spaces on the sides which help focus our attention to the middle. BBC also has a neat thin side bar at the top which also accentuate just how big and important the boxes are.
            </p>

            <h2>Alignment &mdash;Jacob Ottesen</h2>
            <img src="../Eleets.github.io/images/glassdoor.jpg" alt="Screen shot illustrating alignment in use">
            <p>
                GlassDoor.com
            </p>
            <p>
                Design Explanation:<br>
                This website displays excellent alignment because of the text along the left side aligns perfectly with the search bar and the menu button in the right top corner.
            </p>

            <h2>Repetition &mdash; Justin Steele</h2>
            <img src="../Eleets.github.io/images/Screenshot_20161001-134621.jpg" alt="Screen shot illustrating repetition in use">
            <p>
                npr.org
            </p>
            <p>
                This website shows great use of repetition by the way it uses uniform boxes with stories and same text style all throughout the page. The screenshot image shows just the first few points of repetition where each story has bullet points that you can click to lead to other related stories and the text used here is all uniform. Each post has a picture in the same place, a title that has same text bolded and the small words above it that describe the general news it deals with, like politics, World, etc... The whole page uses repetition well and it enhances the page greatly.

            <h2>Contrast &mdash; Heidi Winters</h2>
            <img src="../Eleets.github.io/images/netflix.jpg" alt="Screen shot illustrating contrast in use">
            <p>
                Netflix.com
            </p>
            <p>
                The website I picked is Netflix.com. I think their site really exemplifies contrast with the base of black, and the bright red, and blackâ€™s ultimate contrast, white. I also love the contrast in the bolded vs non-bolded font. The site is very clear and very sharp.

            <h2>Typography &mdash; Madison Allen</h2>
            <img src="../Eleets.github.io/images/edstafford.jpg" alt="Screen shot illustrating typography in use">
            <p>
                edstafford.org
            </p>
            <p>
                This website is a good example of typography because the arrangement draws the eye naturally from top to bottom, and from left to right. The positioning of the homepage icon and sidebar icons is very deliberate, as to give the user the easiest time to navigate the web page. In addition, the banner image compliments the content and the web page as a whole as it ties everything together and naturally draws the eye to it. The content itself is centered and covered by a cyan box to emphasise itself and is the last piece of the website that the eye is naturally drawn to, completing the experience and overall making the website very, very tidy.
